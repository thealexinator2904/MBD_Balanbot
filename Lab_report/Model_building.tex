\section{Model development}
The four base equations of the system have been derived from the sketch shown in \autoref{fig:forces}.

    \begin{align}    \label{eq: base 1 (a)}
        a = \ddot{x} = \frac{\sum F}{m_{cart}} = \frac{F-F_x-F_r}{m_{cart}}
    \end{align}

    \begin{align}    \label{eq: base 2 (alpha)}
            \ddot{\Phi} = \alpha = \frac{\sum T}{I} = \frac{F_x(cos(\Phi)-F_y sin(\Phi))}{I}
    \end{align}

    \begin{align}   \label{eq: base 3 (F_x)}
        F_x = m_{pendulum} \cdot \ddot{x_G} \notag\\
        x_G = x + l sin(\Phi)\notag \\
        \dot{x_G} = \dot{x} + l \dot{\Phi} cos(\Phi)\notag \\
        \ddot{x_G} = \ddot{x} - l \dot{\Phi} sin(\Phi) + l \ddot{\Phi} cos(\Phi)\notag \\ \cline{1-2}
        F_x = m_{pendulum}\cdot(\ddot{x} - l \dot{\Phi} sin(\Phi) + l \ddot{\Phi} cos(\Phi))
    \end{align}
 
    \begin{align}   \label{eq: base 4 (F_y)}
        F_y = m_{pendulum} \cdot (\ddot{y_G} + g)\notag \\
        y_G = l  cos(\Phi)\notag \\
        \dot{y_G} = -l  \dot{\Phi}  sin(\Phi)\notag \\
        \ddot{y_G} = -l \dot{\Phi}^2  cos(\Phi) - l \ddot{\Phi} sin(\Phi)\notag \\\cline{1-2}
        F_y = m_{pendulum} \cdot (g - l \dot{\Phi}^2  cos(\Phi) - l \ddot{\Phi} sin(\Phi))
    \end{align}
    After deriving the base equations from the system, the next goal is to merge the equations and receive final equations in the following form: $\ddot{x} = \dots$ and $\ddot{\Phi} = \dots$. The first final equation describes the acceleration of the system, the other one the angle of the pendulum. To receive this form, \autoref{eq: base 3 (F_x)} gets inserted into \autoref{eq: base 1 (a)}.
    
    \begin{align}\label{eq: final eq for x ddot}
        \ddot{x} \cdot m_{cart} = F-m_{pendulum}(\ddot{x}-l\dot{\Phi}^2 sin(\Phi)+l \ddot{\Phi} cos (\Phi))-\underbrace{b\dot{x}}_\text{F\textsubscript{r}})\notag \\
         \ddot{x} m_{cart} = F-m_{pendulum}\cdot\ddot{x}+m_{pendulum}l\dot{\Phi}^2 sin(\Phi)-m_{pendulum}l\ddot{\Phi}cos(\Phi)-b\dot{x}\notag \\
         \ddot{x}(m_{cart}+m_{pendulum})+b\dot{x}=F+m_{pendulum}l\dot{Phi}^2 sin(\Phi)-m_{pendulum}l\ddot{\Phi}cos(\Phi)\notag \\\notag \\\hline \notag \\
         \ddot{x} = \frac{F+m_{pendulum}l\dot{\Phi}^2 sin(\Phi)-m_{pendulum}l\ddot{\Phi}cos(\Phi)-b\dot{x}}{m_{cart}+m_{pendulum}}
    \end{align}
    \\
    To obtain $\ddot{\Phi} = \dots$, \autoref{eq: base 3 (F_x)} and \autoref{eq: base 4 (F_y)} get inserted into \autoref{eq: base 2 (alpha)}:
    \begin{align} \label{eq: final eq for Phi ddot}
        \ddot{\Phi} I = m_{pendulum} (\ddot{x} - l\dot{\Phi}^2 sin(\Phi) + l\ddot{\Phi} cos(\Phi))\cdot lcos(\Phi)-m_{pendulum}(g-l-\dot{\Phi}^2 cos(\Phi)-l\ddot{\Phi}sin(\Phi))\cdot l\sin(\Phi)\notag \\\notag\\
        \ddot{\Phi} I = m_{pendulum} l cos(\Phi) \ddot{x} \cancel{- m_{pendulum} l^2 cos(\Phi) sin(\Phi) \dot{\Phi}^2} + m_{pendulum} l^2 cos^2(\Phi) \ddot{\Phi} - m_{pendulum}g l sin(\Phi) \dots \notag\\ \dots \cancel{+m_{pendulum}l^2 sin(\Phi)cos(\Phi)\dot{\Phi}^2}+m_{pendulum}l^2 sin^2(\Phi)\ddot{\Phi}\notag \\\notag \\
        \ddot{\Phi} I = m_{pendulum} l cos(\Phi) \ddot{x} + m_{pendulum} l^2 \ddot{\Phi} (\underbrace{cos^2(\Phi)+sin^2(\Phi)}_\text{= 1})-m_{pendulum} g l sin(\Phi)\notag \\
         \ddot{\Phi} I + m_{pendulum}l^2\ddot{\Phi} = m l cos(\Phi)\ddot{x} + m_{pendulum} g l sin(\Phi)\notag \\\cline{1-2}\notag \\
         \ddot{\Phi} = \frac{m_{pendulum}\cdot lcos(\Phi)\ddot{x}+m_{pendulum}\cdot glsin(\Phi)}{I+m_{pendulum}\cdot l^2}
    \end{align}

\subsection{Consequence for the placement of the battery}
The first discussion point should revolve around what physically happens when the battery is placed lower, or higher on the balanbot. As the battery moves further from the axles center (note: the battery generates around xx\% of the balanbots mass), the moment of inertia increases too (\cite{enwiki:satz_von_steiner}). Also the center of gravity moves up the balanbot. This leads to a more unstable system, which means on the one hand, that the actors get more authority over the balanbot, but on the other, that the controller, needs to be tuned to a faster reaction time. One additional factor which lead to this decision was the less than ideal behaviors of the half bridge and the geared motors. 

So after considering all these factors, the battery was placed on the lower possible position (\autoref{fig:lower_bat_pos}).

\subsection{Model of the system}
In this next step, the Model was transferred to Matlab Simulink and tested. For further used this was done using submodels. Which doesn't alter the results and conclusion which are derived of this simulation.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Lab_report/pics/modelBuilding/non_linearized_model.PNG}
    \caption{Simulink Subsystem of non linearized model}
    \label{fig:non_linearized_model}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Analysis of the System}
\subsubsection{theta = 0}
The first part of analysis of our system was to test the behavior of the system when no Force is put on the cart and the pendulum is completely upright when starting.

In the \grqq real world \grqq it would be expected, that the pendulum will begin to fall in a considerably small time (Maybe a few seconds of upright position). This may come from small air movements around the pendulum, an unprecise placement of the pendulum, or more relativistic effects (like brownian particle movement). 

However since these before mentioned interferences weren't modeled in Simulink the pendulum should remain completely upright when simluting under these circumstances. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Lab_report/pics/plots/non_linearized_results_theta_0.eps}
    \caption{Simulation results non-linearized model, $\Theta=0$}
    \label{fig:sim_res_non_lin_t_0}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:sim_res_non_lin_t_0}, the model behaves exactly as expected. The pendulum remains upright and the cart is not moving. For that matter: Complete success

\subsubsection{theta=5}
The next step was to test the model with an initial angle of $\Theta=5^\circ$. In comparison to the last scenario now the pendulum should not remain upright, but should slowly begin to swing. Due to the simulated friction the amplitude of the swinging should decay by time.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Lab_report/pics/plots/non_linearized_results_theta_5.eps}
    \caption{Simulation results non-linearized model, $\Theta=5^\circ$}
    \label{fig:sim_res_non_lin_t_5}
\end{figure}
To make the amplitude decay even clearer, and to exclude all other causes of this decay, one more simulation was made. Now the factor for the friction was increased by a factor of 6, to result in $b=0.6$. All other parameters of the simulation remained the same. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Lab_report/pics/plots/non_linearized_results_inc_friction.eps}
    \caption{Simulation results non-linearized model, $\Theta=5^\circ$}
    \label{fig:sim_res_non_lin_t_5_inc_fric}
\end{figure}
The increased rate of decay can be observed very clearly in \autoref{fig:sim_res_non_lin_t_5_inc_fric}.

\section{Linearization}
To explain the step of Linearization our first step is to show which parts of our function are not linear. According to an general definition of Linearity, linearity describes the property of a system to always respond to a change in one parameter with a proportional change in another parameter (\cite{dewiki:Linearity}). This is not true for sine and cosine functions. These are not linear. Per se this isn't a problem, but it can make some future steps and simulations a lot easier if these function were replaced by a different expression.

A general approach to linearising these functions is the development of a Taylor Polynom with varying degree (The higher the degree of the Polynome, the preciser the approximation). In our specific case we have the added bonus of only using very small angles. When looking closely at the course of the function (\autoref{fig:sine_cos}), it can be seen that the sine and cosine functions at very low angles can also be calculated without the development of a Taylor series (better: only using the first factor of the Taylor series) to estimate the value. The error resulting of this process will be discussed in a future chapter(see \autoref{ssection:Comparison_lin_non_lin}).
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Lab_report/pics/plots/sin_cos.eps}
    \caption{plot of sine and cosine}
    \label{fig:sine_cos}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Excursus Taylorseries}
To further explain how the before mentioned non-linear functions can be replaced, the Taylor Series will be developed for both. The general definition of the Taylor Series is:
\begin{equation}
      T_{f(x;a)} = \sum^\infty_{n=0} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
    \label{eq:Taylor_Series}  
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Sine Function}
To get the corresponding values for the Linerization it was decided to get the developed Taylor series from a collection of formulas(\cite{papula2017mathematische}).
\begin{align}
    \sin \,(x)&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }(-1)^{n}{\frac {x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}} \\
    &=x-{\frac {x^{3}}{6}}+{\frac {x^{5}}{120}}-\cdots \cite[p. 187]{papula2017mathematische}
\end{align}
Since the development of the series stops at the first term, the linearized version of the $\sin(x)$ is $x$.
\subsubsection{Cosine Funktion}
\begin{align}
    cos(x)&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }(-1)^{n}{\frac {x^{2n}}{(2n)!}}\\
    &=1-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}+{\frac {x^{4}}{24}}-\cdots  \cite[p. 187]{papula2017mathematische}
\end{align}

Since the development of the series stops at the first term, the linearized version of the $\cos(x)$ is $1$.
\subsection{Simulink Model}
The linearization of the before developed Matlab model is a fast and easy step. In that our case we just replaced the sine and cosine Blocks with the corresponding gains.
