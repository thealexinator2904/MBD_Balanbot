Due to lockdown restrictions and unavailable charging plugs, the existing battery of the Balanbot could not be used. Therefore, the Balanbot had to be converted to a 4S LiPo battery. The cable that supplies the motorshield also had to be changed. The battery can be fixed to two different variants. However, this also leads to different behavior of the balancing offer. In the next chapter, these two options are compared and a decision is made.

Furthermore, the new fixation of the cable can be seen in these pictures. Both the batteries and the cable are fixed with cable ties to the Balanbot.
